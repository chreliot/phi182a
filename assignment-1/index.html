<p>This essay offers you practice at interpreting and finding reasons in texts and then doing your own analysis. Write at least 1500 words, developing a response to <em>one</em> of the numbered options below.</p>
<p>First, review the [Writing a Philosophy Paper handout][writingho].  Then note: Write as if to a generally-competent reader who is not in the class and does not have a background in philosophy, rather than to, say, me. That means you will need to explain terms or concepts you mention, instead of assuming the reader has read the same material. Remember that good analytical writing supports its explanations and major attributions of claims with brief, targeted quotations, but never lets a point depend on a quotation; every quotation should be explained. Remember do display your reasoning (like, What are you using as assumptions or evidence, and what are you concluding?). Consider how to lead your reader through questions, problems, arguments, objections in an organized, narrative way rather than listing a series of points. Make sure questions and points lead the reader to what comes next.</p>
<p>This is not a research paper,  and accordingly I suggest you not to use outside sources on <em>philosophy</em>, as an explanation which is yours, but which I don&rsquo;t think is quite right will earn you rewards if it&rsquo;s well done, whereas an explanation which matches my understadning but isn&rsquo;t yours will earn you minimal credit, because it does not display much effort or understanding. Either way, please exercise care in using sources and citing them.</p>
<p>Submit your paper to the <code>First Writing Assignment: Submit Here</code> link under the <code>Assignments</code> button on the course&rsquo;s Blackboard site. You do not need to submit a copy on paper. Submit online by <em>May 13</em>.</p>
<p>If you would like to submit a draft version of your essay, please email it to me by April 29 for comments.</p>

<li>
<p>Socrates remarks, indirectly, that the unexamined life is not worth living for a human being. In the first half, draw on Plato&rsquo;s texts we read to show what Socrates might mean by that, and what reasons Socrates might have for holding that view. In the second half, offer your own reasons why it might or might not be right, especially—if you can—responding to the reasons you&rsquo;ve attributed to Socrates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Socrates claims something like that he does not know very much. What, if anything, in the texts we read, does he claim to know? Can you detect a standard for what kinds of things he thinks he knows, and what kinds of things he doesn&rsquo;t? <em>Optionally</em>, spend up to the last third of your essay discussing whether you think that standard is an agreeable one for assessing what <em>you</em> know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Across the dialogues we read, Socrates spends a lot of effort distinguishing philosophy from activities others do which he doesn&rsquo;t consider philosophy. What is the difference, as Socrates presents it? How does what Socrates does (as depicted by Plato) differ from what the sophists and teachers do? Are there ways these two activities are similar? Is Socrates right that they are fundamentally different?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plato depicts in the <em>Meno</em> how learning might work. How does it work, according to this depiction? Why might Plato believe education works like that? Then, in the final third to half, could that be right? Are there reasons to think education actually does or doesn&rsquo;t work this way? (Is there anything right about it?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We considered Vlastos&rsquo;s depiction of how the Socratic elenchus works. Do Socrates&rsquo;s arguments match this pattern? Exploring one or more examples, are there any differences, or do you find them matching his outline?</p>
</li>
</ol>
