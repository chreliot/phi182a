<h1>About</h1>


<p>This site is for the PHI 182A course “Selected Philosophers: Socrates, Epicureans, Stoics” (Spring 2020) at Hofstra University.</p>
<p>In addition to this site, we will also use a Blackboard site. Blackboard is  available through the password-protected Hofstra Portal. Why use both? This site is easy for you to access and for me to publish to, whereas the Blackboard site can present password-protected information. Material in copyright and grades will be available through Blackboard. There is a link to Blackboard at the top of this (and every) page ↑.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-this-site">Structure of this site</h2>
<p>All the site&rsquo;s posts — topics, assignments, test questions, and similar — are available on the <a href="https://chreliot.github.io/phi182a/">front page</a> in chronological order. There are also shortcut buttons at the top if you want to focus on just posts about topics or tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Topics</strong> pages describe topics, which normally span several class sessions. They list <strong>Required reading</strong> assignments, with details about how to find them, as well as further, <em>not-required</em> content you may be interested in under <strong>See also</strong>. <strong>Afternotes</strong>, if any, refer to follow-up items from class, things students send me, and similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under <strong>schedule</strong> is the day-by-day schedule in a stripped-down, minimal format with brief mentions of anything due or otherwise scheduled (readings, assignments, tests).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Tests</strong> pages gradually accumulate test questions for your first test (= “midterm exam”) and second test (= “final exam”). As there are two tests, there will be a list of possible questions for each one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="share-things">Share things</h2>
<p>Think of anything that reminds you of what we&rsquo;re talking about in the course? Students sometimes send me things others might enjoy seeing. It&rsquo;s straightforward for me to add such things to the topics pages.</p>
<h2 id="technical-acknowledgment">Technical acknowledgment</h2>
<p>This site is built with the <a href="https://gohugo.io" title="Hugo static site generator">Hugo</a> static site generator, which is free for everyone,  using parts of the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-xmin/" title="hugo-xmin">hugo-xmin</a> theme by Yihui Xie. And it&rsquo;s hosted for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
