      <description>This essay offers you practice at interpreting and finding reasons in texts and then doing your own analysis. Write at least 1500 words, developing a response to the question below.
Write as if to a generally-competent reader who is not in the class and does not have a background in philosophy, rather than to, say, me. That means you will need to explain terms or concepts you mention, instead of assuming the reader has read the same material.</description>
