<p>This essay offers you practice at interpreting and finding reasons in texts and then doing your own analysis. Write at least 1500 words, developing a response to the question below.</p>
<p>Write as if to a generally-competent reader who is not in the class and does not have a background in philosophy, rather than to, say, me. That means you will need to explain terms or concepts you mention, instead of assuming the reader has read the same material. Remember that good analytical writing supports its explanations and major attributions of claims with brief, targeted quotations, but never lets a point depend on a quotation; every quotation should be explained. Remember to display your reasoning. That is, think of your reader as asking: What assumptions and evidence are you using, and what are you concluding from them? Consider therefore how to lead your reader through questions, problems, arguments, and objections in an organized, narrative way rather than listing a series of points. Make sure each question and point leads the reader to what comes next. Look at the <a href="https://chreliot.github.io/phi182a/assignments/assignment-1/WritingAPhilosophyPaper-2016.pdf">Writing handout</a> for further, general advice.</p>
<p>This is not a research paper, and accordingly I suggest you not lean heavily on outside sources <em>about philosophy</em> (as opposed to on history or psychology or whatever, which won&rsquo;t necessarily help you, but which aren&rsquo;t discouraged). An explanation of a philosophical point or argument which is <em>yours</em>—which you&rsquo;ve produced through your engagement with the assigned texts—but which I don&rsquo;t think is quite right, <em>will earn you rewards</em>, if well done. An explanation which matches my understanding, but which isn&rsquo;t yours or doesn&rsquo;t seem like something you understand, will earn you minimal credit, precisely because it does not reveal your effort or your understanding. In other words, repeating what someone else says about the texts is not the exercise here. Either way, please be careful in using any sources you decide to use, and in citing them, recognizing the severe penalties associated with failing to do so.</p>
<p>Submit your paper to the <code>Second Writing Assignment: Submit Here</code> link under the <code>Assignments</code> button on the course&rsquo;s Blackboard site. (Do not submit a copy on paper.) Submit online by <em>May 16</em>.</p>
<p>Here is the topic: Drawing on the texts, consider the Epicurean and the Stoic attitudes toward <em>one</em> of the following: fear, death, pleasure, happiness, the divine, prognostication and the future, or relationships with others. Show how  each philosophy justifies their attitudes towards that area of life. For example, if you were to choose “the divine,” you would describe what the Epicurus and/or Lucretius and then Epictetus and/or Marcus Aurelius say about  whether god/s exist, and how we should think about them; then you would explain why those philosophers think one <em>should</em> adopt those views—what their reasons are. Optionally, spend up to a third of your essay critiquing their arguments, targeting their assumptions or reasoning.</p>
